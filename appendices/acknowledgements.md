The content of this book has been created by [ EccentricBlock](https://twitter.com/EccentricBlock), based on the information they have learned over the many years within both the information security and blockchain space.

It would not be possible to list everyone who has helped me on this journey, however an attempt will be made because these people have truly been inspirational  in who have freely shared their knowledge and support.

In no particular order:
+ Window Lickers Anonymous, You couldn't ask for better friends.
+  [rel0aded](https://www.twitter.com/0xRel0aded), Inspiring me to write this book (his own [Ethereum Ecosystem](https://www.ethexplainer.com/) book) and for constantly challenging me.
+  [Blockcore Community](https://www.blockcore.net/), I've learnt so much from this friendly, talented community. They have provided inspiration, ideas and helped with QA.
