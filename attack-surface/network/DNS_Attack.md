### Introduction  
The client is most at risk during the application start-up phase; it will have no knowledge of the network and as such must find out this information.  DNS seeds are one of the first methods that is attempted to establish a connection to the network.

### No Authentication
Blockchain clients rely on the DNS protocol which has no authentication or access controls; meaning it would be difficult for a client to verify the legitimacy of the querying server[^4].

### DNS Hijacking/Spoofing
Due to the lack of authentication and encryption/PKI the protocol is susceptible to abuse.  An attacker could poison the DNS server cache or simply trick the user into connecting to a malicious server [^5].

This would permit the attacker to redirect the client to their own malicious nodes; allowing the attacker to feed malicious information about both the blockchain and network state to the client.  This could lead to other attack vectors, such as the `Sybil` attack **(## LINK to Sybil MD ##)**.

### Data Corruption
Data corruption from a malicious or corrupt node is a very real possibility that could have an adverse affect on the connecting client.  Depending on how error handling and data verification is implemented, this could lead to either a Denial of Service (DOS) or other possible attack vectors such as remote code execution.

### Old/Stale Node IPs
DNS Seed nodes in general should dynamically update their connected node list [^2], however some owners maintain a static list.  As such, this list could become old/stale where nodes are no longer available/accessible on those IP addresses.

This could result in a DOS style attack or in a very limited instance, should an attack gain control of the stale IP (which is very unlikely).  They would be able to insert a malicious Seed node into the network.

### Lack of Standards/Controls
Seed nodes are generally operated by the community, as such there may be inconsistencies in both the implementation, configuration and hardening of the seed node and/or DNS provider.

While some efforts have been made to rectify this [^6], is has largely been left to each individual project/community to resolve.  The majority of the time, this area is not addressed and is left unmaintained.
