# Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS)

## What is Denial of Service?
A Denial of Service (DoS) based attack is meant to render a machine, network or application service; taking it offline or inaccessible to its users.

These attacks generally take the form of flooding the target resource with traffic. An attacker could also craft packets of data that elicits a crash, or increases resource usage until the system is starved of resources and is no longer able to function; depriving the users/business of their intended use [^1].

While DoS attacks often result in the target resource becoming unavailable, in general, these types of attacks do not result in loss of information/assets or compromise of the resource.  However, they can prove to be costly from both a loss of opportunity/business and mitigation perspective [^2].

## What is Distributed Denial of Service?
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is very similar to the aforementioned DoS attack.  However, there is one key differentiator, the attack originates from multiple-distributed systems instead of a single source. Resulting in a greatly amplified attack.

Attackers are able to achieve this level of attack by utilising various compromised systems from all over the world. Such as thing is generally called a `bot net`; where an attacker has control of many thousands of "zombie" systems, ready to do their masters bidding [^3].
