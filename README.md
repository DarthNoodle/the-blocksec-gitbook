# The Blockchain Security Book
The blockchain space has been constantly growing for years and with each hype-cycle, more and more people are discovering this brilliant technology.

However, this space has not sufficiently matured and with the lack of any regulations or standards, resembles a "Dumpster Fire" in terms of security.

The goal of this site is:
+ Educate users on the risks associated with blockchain technology.
+ Explain vital security concepts to improve awareness.
